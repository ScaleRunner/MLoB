BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows\u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by   \u2022    \n\n ==etymology== \n The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning \"\"female of the dog\"\" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that \"\"the converse is equally possible.\"\" \n The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  \n The verb meaning to complain in 1930. \n Slang Bitchen \"\"good\"\" is attested to the 1950's \n\n == reclaiming the word bitch == \n The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is \"\"pig\"\", \"\"dog\"\", \"\"cow\"\" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to \"\"reclaim\"\" as bitch simply means a female canine. \n\n It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. \n\n    \n It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women \"\"reclaiming\"\" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word \"\"bitch\"\" any more than it reclaims the word \"\"sinner.\"\" \n\n Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? \n\n \n\n :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, \"\"She's a Bitch\"\".   \n\n ::References are fine  just the name \"\"Missy Elliot\"\" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned \"\"reclaiming\"\" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women\/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   \n\n :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting \"\"querolous\"\", \"\"spiteful\"\", and \"\"malicious\"\" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   \n\n ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   \n\n :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like \"\"bitch\"\" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of \"\"bitch\"\" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it. \n\n :::::However, I still don't see the point of reclamati","39":"\" \n\n *@EdJohnston.

I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point . . . \n\n It is very easy to establish both points, and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them. \n\n 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. \n\n 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after. \n\n - Jed Rothwell \n\n  \n HERE IS more useful information that someone keeps erasing: \n\n Please note that Cal Tech (Lewis et al.) is a false negative, as pointed out by Noninski, Miles and Fleischmann.

According to you, the plug should therefore be fitted with a 3 Amp fuse (determined by the cable). If you did so, you would never get any but the smallest power supplies running. You have to fit a 5 Amp fuse because the very large >40 Amp momentary inrush current lasts long enough that it will blow a 3 Amp fuse.

Does that reduce my credibility, probably yes ha?). I am sory to give this description but I get the impression that i will soon be blamed of beeing a Turkish propagandist, goverment person, racist whatever. Am I too sensitive. No take a look at the discussion history and see that these accusations are there.    \n I am making clear points that any sane unbiased human cam make. First of all the article issues the Genocide as a fact! A fact but with still some discussions (most of them being from the Turkish goverment). This gives the inevitible impression that all issiue is largely accepted(final verdict). Yet it is not!!!  \n Secondly the term Genocide can only be used under certain conditions (as in the holocoust). in this case there is a real doubt if these conditions are met!!! still the article freely and carelessly uses the term just only because some people or countries recogonise it that way. Do we have the right to blame a nation with this ultimate crime just because of that??? Genocide guys this is no joke!!! tell it 100 times for 90 years and Turks are Genociders! Cool! \n third: after building up the genocide idea The article mainly represents the opposing view as the view of the Turkish goverment as clearly described by the headings (the position of Turkey,the position of Turkish authorities, political issues) as well as the content. which inevitibly gives the impression that the opposing view is just bull S*** Turkish propaganda. But it is not! Many Prof. and researcher of the era say that it is not. (As seen in the attached letter). yet fadix wrote that these prof were actually accepting the genocide they were fooled in to this (quoting Israel Charny). this is ridiculous. I dont know who the hell is Israel Charny or he really claims something like that. But please we are not stupid people. this was a letter to the representatives and these people who signed it are Profs. for gods sake!!! also If these prof were in favor of the genocide and really fooled in this conspiracy later they would have said \"\"ok guys I am misslead and fooled into this\"\" and this would be the ultimate tool for Armenian side too ridicule and discredit the Turkish side. Is it the case? No!(so fadix what about credibility) \n\n I am not bitching anyone. I am not using citations and names to blurr peoples mind. if you read my previous adds you will see that i am trying to use a carefull language. I am sorry again if I used harsh words.

Although  substance dualism offers such a distinction, a less extreme form of naturalism known as non-reductive physicalism may also suffice. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states correspond to neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, although physical states do cause mental states, they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events supervene on physical events, describing the emergence of mental properties as correspondent to physical properties. This relationship is known as causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism, yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states - such as epiphenomenalism. \n\n I understand the urge to recast the preceding discussion in a form more similar to the rest of the article. But I don't find this paragraph, although superior to its predecessor, has quite made the grade. I'd like to try to do this in a manner reverse to that of the paragraph; that is, go from the simple viewpoint to the technical rather than vice versa. A single paragraph won't do it. Here is a possible substitute (please take it as a suggestion to be tinkered with): \n ::One may choose as a starting point the point of view that mind and matter constitute different things. One may then take several views about how or even whether they interact. At one extreme there is no interaction at all. At another extreme, mind completely controls matter or the other way around. In between, one may say mind and matter each influence each other to a degree, in some cases one is more in control and sometimes the other. \n ::We might attempt to establish which of these choices is best, but that seems to be out of reach at the moment. Instead, we will simply connect these possibilities with various identifying labels of historical importance.  If one takes the extreme view that mind completely controls matter, or vice versa, in effect the controlled aspect is simply an appendage of the controlling aspect, and may be considered simply as a property of the controlling aspect. The two substances are then simply one, albeit perhaps with some additional attributes, and this viewpoint is called monism, which takes on several forms as described in that Wikipedia article.  \n ::An example, is epiphenomenalism, that mind is just a peculiar side effect of matter. Thomas Huxley described the relation between mind and matter as follows: \n :: \n ::Huxley goes on to say he sees no difference from humans in this regard. Very similar to this point of view is reductive physicalism adopted by some neuroscientists: \n ::{{quote|...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells... |Eric R. Kandel|In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind}} \n ::The view that mind and matter are different is called dualism, and it again takes on several forms described in that Wikipedia article. Within this description are various degrees of control of one entity over the other, ranging from complete autonomy of one or both entities, to some degree of interdependence. Considerable interest attaches as to what forms of interdependence might arise. \n ::For example, even if mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states bear some correspondence with neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, physical states do cause'' mental states, but they are not ontologically reducible to them.

I ask that because it sounds like you have the common \"\"I've heard America is this way\"\" idea. I'm an American, live in a nice city with many friends in different social classes and with different backgrounds and I would say that religion is totally on the back-burner with people choosing whatever they like and not dropping it on others. I personally feel religion is for the most part a crock, and when I discuss that fact I get a wide variety of replies and thoughts, but nobody is trying to convert me. If I see a televangalist on TV I just turn the channel, no big deal. Now as far as the midwest gos, I can't really speak from experience but my idea is that the US as a Christian fundamentalist factory is WAY overblown in the foreign press. We get sterotyped as a caricature of what we are...like when you get a charcoal sketch of yourself at the beach and the guy draws your ears really big and has your head all mishapen to highlight your features, way overblown! I could say that I don't like all the German shit-porn videos that I know they are really into and that I should include a section on the Germany page about fecal-defecater-porn because it is so prevelant in their society when really that is kind of a personal thing, but I realize that Germany really isn't THAT into filming themselves shit on each other and I know it is an overblown viewpoint of Germans in America. Does that go too far to make a point? Sorry if I offended any Germans, totally for explanation sake ) Anyway, we need a rebuttal section first that highlights the fact that some of this is misconception propogated by ignorance of Americans and religous extremism too   \t   \n  \t   \n ::Rama is perhaps unwittingly revealing a major root of anti-American sentiment abroad. Ignorance.   |   \t   \n \n ::: I don't say that this is true exactly the way it is shown on some media. Just that lots of people percieve it this way, and that some traits in American Weltanshaung confort this perception. The \"\"In God we trust\"\", swearing on the Bible, religious proselytism abroad and other punctual details like this can give an overall impression which is the subject of the article.  \"","207":"Supporting gay rights does not put him in opposition with his church.

I suspect that whoever wrote that bit had no idea what he was talking about.  \n\n I find the whole entry for theocracy completely unsatisfactory, starting with the definition. Again, it reads as if the writers had no idea about the subject and have it confused with several other topics. I think it would be hopeless to try to repair the page by successive edits. It needs to start with a proper definition of theocracy that distinguishes theocracy from caesaropapism and clearly says that a pious society is NOT by definition a theocracy, and also that church establishment is not compatible with theocracy, but is compatible with caesaropapism. Theocracy is a form of government, not a social quality, it can be defined as \"\" \"\"a government in which the persons and institutions of the religious order either control or replace the organs of the civil government.\"\" (Sen McGlinn, Church and State, page 243).  \n\n Then it is clear that Iran is a theocracy, Saudi Arabia is not, and so on through all the other questions discussed here. The problem is a vague and too broad definition at the outset. One should rather start with a clear and hard definition, and later note that in popular usage the term has become an almost meaningless pejoritive applied to religion in public places.  \n\n Can somebody enlighten me about how one goes about fixing the page?

My remarks are meant to move us past the conflict on the talk page. Our sources are, of course, the verifiable secondary sources, and we are not to do original research. As CTSWynekan has said, Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Frankly, it's enough for me that the various Christian views are presented fairly and accurately, the various Jewish views are presented fairly and accurately, the various historical views (whether by specialists or nonspecialists) are presented fairly and accurately, and all other views are presented fairly and accurately. All should be given the appropriate weight and context. That is enough of a synthesis for me.  \n ::But, we all have our subjective views, and many of our views have clashed, hence we have been bogged down in one paragraph for far too long. What bothers me is the binary thinking evidenced by some (many, not all), which has polarized the debate. We should also, of course, be sure not to confuse our various subjective viewpoints with the objective actual, verifiable and factual (as someone once said). So in the end, I essentially agree with you. My remarks on thesis-antithesis-synthesis and the rest have to do with the debate on this page, not with the article itself. I want us to move past conflict so we can examine the verifiable sources, and put aside our own views while still making sure that we (any \"\"we\"\") are accurately represented, as are the views of others. To paraphrase Ross Perot, everybody stop fighting and get to work! If you'll check you'll notice that I've done very little work on the article itself; most of my efforts have been focused on the talk page. \n ::NPOV (when we reach it) will be a synthesis accurately reporting the views of all, and referenced to the appropriate verifiable sources.That said, I have been as frustrated as anyone else and needed to vent my spleen (which perhaps presented my POV more strongly than I have in the past.

It may go back if we run into further unresolved conflict. \n ::My \"\"claim that it is a conundrum\"\" alludes to how the issue of historicity is handled at Socrates, where any debate has been much more peaceful and civilized.   \n\n \"","277":"T IS PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT MAKE WIKIPEDIA HORRIBLE.

The rationale given for this is that Wikipedia does not conform to international bodies and that self-determination of name trumps regardless of international disputes between states. Ergo - why are the people of the Republic of China held to a different standard? This inconsistent logic smells of prejudice towards either  the people of Taiwan and\/or the people of Greece. I therefore propose that this article be renamed Republic of China to keep things consistent.  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by     \n\n  \n A few points I'd like to add. \n\n # The People's Republic of China recognizes the self-determined name of Republic of Macedonia. \n # The People's Republic of China does not recognize the self-determination of the Republic of China (Taiwan). \n # The US government, did not recognize Republic of Macedonia in 1944 (the US state department at the time calling it \"\"communist demagoguery\"\") but flip flopped in 2003 and now recognizes it. \n # The US government, orginally did recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan)  right up until it flip-flopped and removed recognition in the 1970s. \n\n This opens up the secondary question is Wikipedia taking a principled approach on international issues or simply parroting the current foreign policy of leading nations? (i.e. mob rule)  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by     \n\n : For the reasons given here: Talk:Taiwan\/Archive 20. A lot of discussion so a lot of reading, but if you're interested in the issue I think well worth reading at least the highlights of it.  \n\n :: For the same reason that we have North Korea not the 'Democratic People Republic of Korea' and we have Burma not the 'Republic of the Union of Myanmar'. It is policy to use the common English name. Not the official name; not the UN designated name; not the preferred name of the local people; but the common name as used by English speaking people to describe the subject. See WP:Naming Conventions for more information about how article names are decided on Wikipedia.    \n\n ::: Naming this article 'Taiwan' does not contribute clarity. Titling the article 'Taiwan' may lead the reader to belief that such a country as 'Taiwan' exists, or that 'Taiwan' can be equated to the 'Republic of China', which are both invalid arguments in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. The fact is that no country called 'Taiwan' exists, and that the 'Republic of China' cannot be casually associated with 'Taiwan' as historically they are very distinct entities. It also contravenes the rules for Wikipedia's neutral POV rules, as it promotes the DPP's assertion that Taiwan should edge toward independence by increasing the usage of 'Taiwan' without officially abandoning the 'Republic of China' name. It is for the sake of objectiveness that the official name should be used. See: WP:Neutral point of view   \n ::::Again see the requested move, where this was debated in long detail to arrive at the current title, best representing consensus and common usage. The article is Taiwan reflecting the common name for the country.  \n\n :::::Thank you  for your clarification on this matter.

I guess someone researching him would just have to wonder why his political career suddenly sputtered the summer of 2008, wiki won't mention what everyone else is writing long stories about. \n\n Its probably ended his career in politics. Whether the story is true or false or not is debatable, and it doesn't matter if you don't like the original source, leftist wiki editors protecting Edwards: the story now is how the allegations are damaging him and have already probably lost him any chance at his best chance at furthering his career: the VP slot. Its an important story, its an important fact that his behaviour has caused a firestorm. Suppressing the story _completely_ is making wikipedia a laughing stock. Gawker, Mickey Kaus, countless bloggers are going on about it and pointing to it as proof of wiki's leftist bias. You aren't really hiding anything anyone doesn't know already, and you're making the site you claim to be protecting look stupid.  \n\n Its noteworthy, very much so. Its verifiable that the scandal, true or false, is affecting his career (many people have been hurt by scandals that turned out to be false, that doesn't make the news of the damage any less noteworthy). It has innumerable sources as to the effect on Edwards' career. Its time to lift the blackout and start debating on the wording of a section about it. You can't avoid it forever. Are you just trying to bluff it out until the election is over in hopes of minimizing any tangential damage you think it might cause Obama?  \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by     \n\n :Is it really a surprise that people are fighting to get the truth posted on Wikipedia? I recently had to deal with the Nazi admins on Wiki and let me tell you, I could honestly say they act like a bunch of kids in the movie \"\"Lord of the Flies\"\". The majority of them will not listen to reason and when you present them with facts they disregard them. There is also no one managing this site from the top who gives a crap about what is going on here. The only way the owners of Wikipedia will challenge a Nazi admin is when it involves legal action. Wikipedia is the anti-Christ of the internet. Also a majority of the Nazi admins are liberals and the only way to become an admin is to be voted in by another liberal Nazi admin. Once again, \"\"Lord of the Flies\"\". Just wait and see. I will be hounded by many of them for posting just this little snippet. Its pretty much a given. They will probably ban my IP or kick me off the site for a few days. If they dont like what you are saying, that is what they do. They pretty much do what they want. Pretty pathetic.    \n\n :: It is obvious that there is a calculated effort by the mainstream media (MSM) to suppress any information about this story. The MSM has jumped on stories with much less to go on than this Edwards story. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the MSM, and the liberal websites like Wikipedia, won\u2019t talk about the bad things that happen in the Democrat party because it is the party and ideals that they personally believe in. It is human nature to not attack yourself and the Democrats will not attack themselves by talking about Edwards cheating on his wife who is dying of cancer. This is a silver bullet for the Democratic Party especially because there is a presidential race going on. Why do you think the MSM sits on stories until months or weeks before an actual election takes place? It is a new phenomena occurring in the MSM where they run a story with little facts in an effort to smear a person (typically a politician) then they let the people decide if they want to believe it. This usually occurs with little or if any facts to back it up. All the major networks do it all the time. A perfect example is the Dan Rather forged documents story about President Bush. They unleashed the story with little to no facts right before a Presidential election.

The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazi\u2019s. However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country.  This reminds me of how Ms. Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event. But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did.  \n\n Therefore, a network of over 40,000 facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate, hold and kill Jews and other victims. In addition after the beginning of WWII, the Nazi\u2019s began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren't allowed to leave at all. Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death, but the Jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitler\u2019s orders. Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non-Jewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas. In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos, concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps, and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren't respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler. Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazi\u2019s blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country. \n\n Anne Frank Diary \n\n Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust. She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary. I believe that she had a messenger, to tell her what was going on outside. Anne Frank was born in June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany. She was born as a Jew, and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the 1920\u2019s because it was during World War I. She was hiding because herself and her family didn't want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place. I don\u2019t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? Why hurt the Jews? What did they do to get killed? \n\n Change of the Freedom Writers \n\n Should It\u2019s amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded. From a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story. They didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed. Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach. Many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation. They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School. The reason why, is because it was then when it all started. From failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to SUCCESS. For the most part, most of them are doing very well. They are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. They are living the toast of change. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Links \n http:\/\/www.firststreetconfidential.com\/images\/images-history\/0921-the-holocaust.jpg \n http:\/\/www.annefrank.org\/en\/Anne-Frank\/ \n http:\/\/images.publicradio.org\/content\/2009\/08\/12\/20090812_anne_frank_33.jpg \n http:\/\/www.the-trades.com\/article.php?id=5438","378":"==Identity of monarchs?== \n\n The article on Arbella Stuart mentions \u2014 but does not identify by name \u2014 a Duke of Parma, a Pope, a cardinal who was the Pope's brother, as well as the kings of France, Spain and Poland.

You don't know me but I just wanted to say thank you for this comment you made at AN\/EW regarding 155blue's edit warring report against me (for edits on my own talk page). Believe it or not, she also reported my supposed edit warring at the vandalism noticeboard, which of course was quickly dumped. She has apparently been educated several times about what vandalism is, but she continues to falsely accuse (and report) other editors of it. And she ignored me when I educated her about WP:3RR and WP:NOT3RR. I see that she also issued you a bogus warning just above this thread (without a signature, yet again). She doesn't know the difference between WP:PROD and WP:AFD, which doesn't surprise me because she warned me about moving a \"\"warning\"\" - on my own talk page, no less - that was actually a template. The most concerning issue, though, is that she only has 300 or so edits - most of them in the past four months - and has shown a pattern of of rashly issuing warnings to, and filing reports at various noticeboards about, editors. Even very experienced ones, like yourself. This pattern of hers seems to indicate that she prefers to go straight to noticeboards instead of having proper discussions with editors first, even though some of the editors are vastly more experienced than her and the allegations are flawed.

This stuff really happens.  Even in cases where the votes are all legitimate, it doesn't hurt to wait, and of course, when there are issues such as vote stacking or any controversy, no non-admin should close.

Not only have project members failed to address that potential constructively and proactively, but they've consistently and stridently refused to believe that any such potential for abuse exists.The more Wikipedians observe this project in action, the more expressions of concern (like those above) you're going to receive - because the way this project currently functions is inimical to Wikipedia's policies and best practices, and there appears to be zero desire on the part of active project members to grapple with good-faith concerns. Instead, in keeping with the general battleground mentality embodied in this project, the response has been to bunker down, circle the wagons, and hit back aggressively at any concerns that are voiced.

Those are older FAs that were established before the rigorous overhaul of fair use images in articles. Per the actual criteria, you need to have something about the image beyond simple identification (the only exclusion to that is the infobox image). My fear with the article in FAC is that criticism will arise about how influential this character is King's novels, yet how slim the article is on information about him. If you feel it is ready, then go for it. The worst that can happen is that it is not promoted, in which case you will most likely have a lot more eyes telling you what you can do to improve it, thus making it that much better.

It was a bookstore clearance sale pick-up. I lose reading material in airports and on planes all the time. When you get a chance could you look at an edit to Jimmy Page. A editor who has been tagged as a sock of a blocked account keeps removing a string of sentences which appear to have several valid citations.

But their reason just seems to say it was OK for them to delete the referenced text because another user said it was OK to do so.

Drmies, you accused be of personal attack after I stated to Lihaas that I had nothing in common with him because of his stated association with fascism and National Socialism that I refer to as \"\"Nazism\"\" as it is on Wikipedia. Now you and others claim that maybe he is misrepresenting himself - that he meant to say that he is a \"\"democratic nationalist socialist\"\" - - first of all he states on his user page that he is a fascist - and bear in mind that National Socialism as on Wikipedia and in many scholarly works is recognized as a form of fascism. If there is any question as to whether I falsely claimed he was a fascist and Nazi (in the sense of the broader \"\"National Socialism\"\") - look at this userbox on his page: \n\n  \n The infoboxes repeatedly state \"\"National Socialist\"\" as \"\"NS\"\" on multiple infoboxes. He also has other infoboxes that support far-right ultranationalist political parties- that indicate even further that he is aligned with fascism and National Socialism (as in Nazism), such as: \n  - Jobbik is a far right Hungarian ultranationalist movement with a paramilitary movement called Magyar G\u00e1rda (Hungarian Guard) - it is anti-Semitic - it accuses Israel of \"\"buying up\"\" Hungary and its paramilitary group attacks Romani (Gypsy) people. \n\n  - Ataka - Greek short form for National Union Attack - far-right Bulgarian nationalist movement - acknowledged by all parliamentary parties as a xenophobic movement and a national threat to Bulgaria's ethnic minorities, it known for hate speech, the Ataka's leader's son sent an anti-Romani email to members of the European Parliament - sniding that Hungary is \"\"full\"\" of Romani. \n  L.A.O.S. short form for Popular Orthodox Rally - a far-right Greek nationalist movement - it opposes any immigration from outside the European Union \n \n True, he has contradictory userboxes - it may mean he is politically confused or has mixed opinions. Bottom line, from the statements of his userboxes, he is not merely a nationalistic socialist, his userboxes make clear that he is a fascist National Socialist and that he supports multiple far-right ultranationalist political parties - two of which have promoted xenophobia towards ethnic minorities - Jobbik towards Jews and Romani, and Ataka towards Romani. When Lihaas started confronting me, I stated on Lihaas' userpage that I fundamentally opposed his views and do not want to associate with him or talk with him because of those views - that is my choice and my right not to be forced to accept unwanted postings on my talk page. I don't care whether he wants to keep them or not, I think he has the right of personal liberty to post his political views - but he should not expect everyone to respect his stated support of fascism, National Socialism, and far-right ultranationalist movements - as I said, I do not want to talk with a person who adheres to such views.  \n\n I am preparing my final retirement from Wikipedia so please respond here, but I want an apology for administrators' mishandling of this, I was honest and stating what he himself posted on his user page when I said he was a fascist and a Nazi, his userpage says that he \"\"is a Fascist\"\" and that he \"\"is a National Socialist\"\" and his support of Jobbik and other far-right ultranationalist parties - just put those together in your mind and take note where the term National Socialism redirects to on Wikipedia: Nazism - and I referred to Nazism in its general form of an ideology and its continuation in a general form as neo-Nazism. Lihaas may claim that he does not support German Nazism, but when I first noticed these tendencies on his talk page - I noticed the anti-Romani, anti-Semitic Jobbik movement first of all, then looked on and saw the other two infoboxes I mentioned - all the same - I do not want to talk with someone who supports far-right ultranationalist movements that promote xenophobia - that is my choice not to talk to the person and my right not to have the person talk to me after I have told them not to.  \"","609":"\" \n\n ==Wikiproject Automobiles Notification== \n Hi Bok269, you were on the list of members at WikiProject Automobiles and we are introducing a new way of listing members, as the old list was becoming too long.

In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.[2] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more than 90% certain most of it is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels.[3][4][5][6] These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized countries.[7][A] \n\n :Climate model projections are summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicate that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 1.1 to 2.9 \u00b0C (2 to 5.2 \u00b0F) for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.4 to 6.4 \u00b0C (4.3 to 11.5 \u00b0F) for their highest.[8] The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.[9][10] \n\n :An increase in global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, and a probable expansion of subtropical deserts.[11] Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic and would be associated with continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely effects of the warming include more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events, species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes, and changes in agricultural yields. Warming and related changes will vary from region to region around the globe, with projections being more robust in some areas than others.[12] In a 4 \u00b0C world, the limits for human adaptation are likely to be exceeded in many parts of the world, while the limits for adaptation for natural systems would largely be exceeded throughout the world. Hence, the ecosystem services upon which human livelihoods depend would not be preserved.[13] \n\n :Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),[14] whose ultimate objective is to prevent \"\"dangerous\"\" anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) climate change.[15] Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions[16]:10[17][18][19]:9 and to assist in adaptation to global warming.[16]:13[19]:10[20][21] Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required,[22] and that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) relative to the pre-industrial level.[22][B] Analyses by the United Nations Environment Programme (published in 2011)[23] and International Energy Agency (2011)[24] suggest that current efforts to reduce emissions may be inadequately stringent to meet the UNFCCC's 2 \u00b0C target. \n\n  \n I have some problems with this revision. In my opinion, parts of it are too long, too technical\/jargony, confusing, or imprecise\/vague. \n\n ===Suggested revision=== \n\n Cited sources are given later on in the references section. If other editors agree with parts of my suggested revision, I'll change the references to make them consistent with the rest of the article: \n\n  \n :Global warming refers to the rising average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and its projected continuation. In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.[2] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and is evident from observations of increases in global air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level (IPCC, 2007d, SYR 6.1 Observed changes in climate and their effects, and their causes). \n\n :Since the start of the industrial revolution in 1750, human activities have lead to an increase in the concentration of heat-trapping \"\"greenhouse\"\" gases in the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, but also through changes in land use, such as deforestation (Denman, et al, 2007, FAQ 7.1 \ufeff\ufeffAre the Increases in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases During the Industrial Era Caused by Human Activities?\ufeff). Scientists are more than 90% certain that most of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century was caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (IPCC, 2007d, SPM 2.

Also, Permyakia is heavily dotational, relying on the federal transfers to form a significant portion of its budget.  Problem is, federal government is not always good with transferring funds timely, which, as you imagine, creates all sorts of issues.  Perm Oblast, on the other hand, is a donor, and once both budgets are merged, it will ease the pain somewhat (but note that during 2006 there will still be two separate budgets, so there will be a transitional period).  Another thing\u2014Permyakia will still have a special status within new Perm Krai.  The main scoop is that Permyakia will no longer need to rely on federal government's transfers (but will, of course, become dependent of Perm Krai's budget), and Perm Oblast will gain access to Permyakia's resources.

When majority stakes were sold in former state enterprises according to the classic German method, especially to entities associated with the state enterprises' managers, questions were asked as to whether the majority shareholders were unduly profiting by not treating their part-subsidiaries at arm's length.

A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation has made an attempt to contact Stephen Colbert through his staff. In the meantime, I'm still gathering more information about the specific linking issue.   (Lee)  \n :That's an edit summary in an admin's block log, not a message sent to anyone in any official capacity  contrary to popular opinion, some Wikipedians do have a sense of humor. The message that was sent to him would represent an attempt to ascertain identity following an established procedure. If Colbert wants to promote his site here, all he needs to do is make a trivial effort to establish his identity to the Foundation, which is already seeking to contact him as we speak. Not that I have anything to do with this, but I thought I might alert you to a simple way around this.   (Lee)  \n\n :Sheeh. I apologize for not being more clear. I didn't exactly expect you to go searching through miscellaneous site logs when I mentioned that someone from the Foundation was attempting to contact Colbert. The Wikimedia Fountation is, just to clear, the non-profit organization that handles Wikipedia's business and legal affairs. They're seeking to contact him, actually, over events related to the previous night's \"\"Wikiality\"\" discussion on the Report  this is something I heard through the grapevine and not anything I know much about  but I thought perhaps that if this site is indeed a scrappy little underdog of a marketing campaign for book whick Colbert considers his baby, he or a representative might want to bother to have a fifteen minute discussion which would allow tek-related information to happily coexist with Wikipedia's policies. He doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to, but since the folks at the tekjansen site seem to be somewhat preoccupied with the status of a single link here  and have us listed as their top referrer, despite the link being down half the time  I thought the option might be of interest. No, huh?   (Lee)  \n\n :Re-read the above. I did not say they had to falsify the list in order for Wikipedia to be the top referrer. I suggested a brief phone conversation might be worth the trouble if we're generating the bulk of their traffic and they're looking to promote. Take a deep breath. \n :I also did not say Colbert has to verify his identity in any way. However, since the site seems to fail several points of our linking policy, yes, the site is likely to be removed without additional information being provided. I'm sorry, but the \"\"it's relevant anyway\"\" angle is fairly weak; the only reason this material would be an especially relevant resource on Colert would be if it was actually Colbert's writing. It does not have information on anything relevant to Stephen's biography. Generally speaking, we don't count fan forums as an invaluable, unique resource  see WP:EL.  That leaves the book, which, while possibly being Colbert's, is irrelevant if it's not. I could write a novel about Charlene and post in on my website, and that would also not be relevant. Or a novel about Stephen Colbert for that matter. In any case, I'm sorry that for some reason I seem to have pissed you off. I have no idea why you're so angry about this, but I assure you again, as I have assured you before, it's nothing personal.   (Lee)  \n\n My AMA request, which you seem to have found, was a private request for advice on how to handle a situation which has become somewhat tense. You are welcome to conduct a straw poll if you want  I haven't followed through on that personally because I've already have openly solicited comments from editors at the Colbert talk page, and believe we already have a pretty good index of what most experienced editors think of the link. But go for it. As I have stated before, if there's a consensus to add the link, I won't remove it. I never, never, ever, not even once said that I will \"\"refused to allow the link unless [myself] or a Wikipedia \"\"official\"\" is contacted by someone at the Colbert Report\"\" so please stop misrepresenting my remarks.

I would love for you to present the sources you claim contradict the Yeshua transliteration. I for one am curious as to the nature of the so-called controversy you describe \n *I am not sure what you mean about \"\"Judaic sources\"\" claiming \"\"authoritarian ownership of Hebrew.  Which sources?  Did you mean Alkalai and Chomski?  I think they are authorities because of their research as linguists, not because they are Jewish (and I can only assume they are from their names, but I have no idea whatsoever how they self-identify or what their beliefs are).  The textbook on Biblical Hebrew I used in college was definitely written by a Gentile, I do not have it on hand; the Hebrew-English Concordance we used, Brown-Drivers-Briggs, was not by Jews.  So when you refer to \"\"Judaic sources\"\" I really do not know what you are talking about and you have to spell it out for me. \n * You want my sources contradicting your transliteration?  Please read my first comment on the talk page again.  Please read the second one.  Please read Andrew Card's.  I never claimed to have any sources contradicting your transliteration, indeed, I said - and I wrote this yesterday, it was in my first comment - I said your reconstruction was plausible.  our reason for reverting it is not because we have sources contradicting it.  It is because we know of no historical sources that provide Jesus' name in Hebrew or Aramaic (which by the way I never said were unrelated.  Never.)  Andre, Leadwind, and I are reverting your edit because we are supporting a consensus reached by many editors, who reached that conclusion because no historian has ever provided a historical source for Jesus' name in Hebrew or in Aramaic.  Will Durant speculated what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name would have been but it is a speculation.  There is no mainstream view, because there are no historical sources.  I said this several times: N-O S-O-U-R-C-E-S.  Why do you ask me for my source when I gave as my reason the fact that there are n...o  s...o..u..r..c..e..s?  \n * You want to know the controversy I describe.  The Yeshu stories in the Talmud are considered by some modern scholars to be about Jesus (and by the way, those modern scholars do not see them as pejorative of Jesus but as reflecting through stories Jews' ambivalent feelings about Jesus and Christianity), but many modern scholars as well as medieval scholars argue that they are not about Jesus (in which case they cannot possibly be pejorative about Jesus and Christianity).  One reason why there is this controversy (is it Jesus?  is it not?) is because it is unclear what \"\"ha notzri\"\" means - many argue that it is a reference to a religious community described by Jerimiah (long before Jesus was born, and not \"\"Nazarene\"\").  And of course the other reason is that it is not at all clear that Yeshu or Yeshua was Jesus' name in Aramaic.  All of this controversy does not mean that Yeshu or Yeshua was not Jesus' name in Aramaic.  It does mean that we do not know.  My point was that the one case where we definitely have an Aramaic name, the earliest text with an Aramaic name one might think was Jesus's Aramaic name, there is lots of controversy as to whether this name has any connection to Jesus, and whether the name is proper Aramaic, and what the name means or who it refers to.  If there is all this controversy over the earliest texts we have with an Aramaic name, it seems to me that the most one could do today is say that Jesus' Aramaic name may have been Yeshu or Yeshua.  We just have no reliable historical documents relating to this question. \n\n Without any reliable sources, any claim as to what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name was would be original research, and that is forbidden by Wikipedia policy. \n\n Get it?  I am not saying my sources about Jesus' are better than your and I never said my sources were better than yours (I simply pointed out what was false in some claims you made about Hebrew and Aramaic.  And that has nothing to do with someone being Jewish and someone being Christian, it was you who suggested and seem to continue to suggest that.  You are not wrong \"\"because\"\" you are Christian.  You are just wrong.  And Christian who is also a scholar of Biblical Hebrew and of Aramaic and of Ancient Near Eastern history would also tell you you were wrong about your claims about Hebrew and Aramaic).  I am saying that THERE ARE NO HISTORICAL SOURCES AS TO JESUS\"\" HEBREW OR ARAMAIC NAME so any Wikipedian making a reconstruction IS VIOLATING NOR. \n\n Why do I have to repeat this?  Reread my first comment to you explaining my revert.  I continue to stand my it.  Every sentence of my first comment is true.    |   17:14, 21 January 200","800":"WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING ARSEHOLE!!!

Superinten-  \n dent H. C. Hartman served as master of  \n ceremonies, introducing the program  \n and speakers.  \n\n Elder Leon Robbins from St. Louis  \n offered the opening prayer. Elder G. E.  \n Hutches, president of the board of di-  \n rectors, sketched the \"\"Historic Back-  \n ground,\"\" relating the activities of the  \n academy commission from the day it  \n was organized until the day in October,  \n 1945, when the end of the long search  \n for an academy site was reached.  \n\n A hearty welcome was extended to the  \n academy from Centralia by Mr. Julius Ed-  \n wards from the First National Bank and  \n from the community by Mr. John  \n Shindler.  \n\n Elder G. R. Fattic, Central Union ed-  \n ucational secretary, outlined the purposes  \n and objectives of our three hundred ed-  \n ucational institutions the world over,  \n assuring the hearers that we had come  \n\n to be a permanent institution in this  \n community and the state of Missouri.  \n\n Elder E. E. Cossentine, president of  \n Union College, welcomed Sunnydale  \n \\cademv into the sisterhood of acade-  \n mies comprising Union's territory. He  \n stated that Union College would be  \n happy to accept the first graduates as  \n well as future graduates in view of the  \n fact that Sunnydale will be staffed quite  \n largely by fully accredited teachers from  \n Union College.  \n\n Mr. Hartman pointed out the loca-  \n tions of the proposed building sites for  \n the girls' dormitory, boys' domitory, ad-  \n ministration building, teachers' cottages,  \n superintendent's home, and other fu-  \n ture structures to be erected on the  \n spacious nine-acre plot. He then intro-  \n duced Mr. Robert Deering, Columbia  \n arcritect who drew the plans for the  \n girls' domitory. Mr. Deering briefly out-  \n lined the outstanding features of the  \n building which will house 80 girls and  \n expressed his belief in its beauty, prac-  \n tibility, and adequacy.  \n\n Staff Sergeant Willard L. Bresee was  \n next introduced as building supervisor  \n and he made a brief response. Because  \n of Sgt. Bresee's experience in supervising  \n the erection of a number of other large  \n buildings, such as the auditorium and  \n Don Lo\\e industrial building located  \n on the Union College campus, we can  \n be assured of well constructed edifices.  \n\n In an earnest dedicatory prayer Elder  \n C. M. Babcock from Columbia pre-  \n sented the plot of ground to the throne  \n of grace, asking that the purposes for  \n which it had been set aside be carried  \n out.  \n\n Then with Mr. Hartman at the con-  \n trols of a caterpillar tractor and Elder  \n Hutches guiding the plow, Mr. HerscJiel  \n Turner driv ing -a team of typical Missouri  \n mules and Elder Babcock holding an-  \n other plow, deep furrows were made in  \n preparation for laving the foundation  \n of the new building.  \n\n In spite of cloudv, wet weather every-  \n one seemed to recognize the advantages  \n of a location where pure air, sunshine, and  \n spacious, roomy lawns provide an ideal  \n setting for student home life.  \n\n A serious, interested atmosphere pre-  \n \\aded the group as this milestone was  \n reached, and we rejoice that our acad-  \n emy is started; for its primary purpose  \n\n is to help save Missouri youth and aid  \n in preparing them for the kingdom of  \n God.  \n\n MRS.

I would immensely prefer it stays Chad Johnson until we're week or two into the NFL season and we see what Chad is predominantly called by the media, and then fix the article accordingly when consensus backed up with sources is reached. I am, however, perfectly willing to help transition the article to Chad Ocho Cinco if he is indeed called \"\"Chad Ocho Cinco\"\" or \"\"Ocho Cinco\"\" by the majority of journalists and broadcasters, but I would like to see reliable sources calling him Ocho Cinco before we change the article.    \n\n My feeling is that the guy is named Ocho Cinco, and whether you think it's dumb, or you think he's an attention whore, that is in fact his name.

The Apple Watch is capable of receiving phone calls as well as iMessage and SMS Texts. It can track fitness, run third-party apps built using WatchKit, Apple's new API for Apple Watch software development, control the Apple TV, as well as act as a walkie-talkie and a viewfinder and remote shutter-release for an iPhone camera. \n\n ===Design=== \n Apple Watch will be available in a number of customisable design configurations, across three distinct 'collections', in two sizes (38\u00a0mm and 42\u00a0mm), making 34 individual models. Considering the number of physical models, and the wide variety of digital watch faces available on each model, the potential to personalise Apple Watch is considerable. Apple's head of design Jony Ive stated in an interview after Apple Watch was announced that the total possible number of unique designs is 'in the millions', although it is as yet unclear whether this is an exaggeration. \n\n Apple Watch also features a new, pressure-sensitive touchscreen that can distinguish between a tap and a press, and features a dial called a digital crown, which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, allowing the user to interact with content on the display without obscuring it with their fingers. It also features a 'Taptic Engine'; a linear actuator which provides haptic feedback to users when they interact with the watch, or when they receive notifications, as well as allowing them to share physical 'taps' with other Apple Watch users. \n\n The watch is charged by means of inductive charging, using a cable similar to the MagSafe cable for Apple's MacBook family of laptops. Reports also suggest that the retail box for the 'Edition' series of the Apple Watch will act as a combined charging and display stand.","827":"== Soulscanner is a RCMP agent == \n\n Thank you, Soulscanner.

If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death. \n\n :2. If any one bring an accusation against a man, and the accused go to the river and leap into the river, if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house. But if the river prove that the accused is not guilty, and he escape unhurt, then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death, while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser.  \n\n :3. If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death.  \n\n The second law seems bizarre by modern standards. It appears to be the source of the dismissive phrase, \"\"Go jump in the lake.\"\"  (Compare to the Yiddish expression, Nem zich a vaneh! \"\"Go take a bath!  Go jump in the lake!\"\") \n\n There are 282 such laws in the Code of Hammurabi, each no more than a sentence or two.  The 282 laws are bracketed by a pukeworthy Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself, and a narcissistic Epilogue in which he affirms his authority and sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws. \n\n Note that Wikipedia is not even as evolved as Hammurabi, since Wikipedia does not even do the level of due process required of Hammurabi's first law. \n\n Given that Wikipedia has adopted an anachronistic pre-Hammurabic tribalistic ochlocracy that does not even rise to the level of the Code of Hammurabi, is it any wonder that Wikipedia is the venue of recurring classic liminal social drama that reprises the oldest stories in the annals of human history?   \n\n Hammurabi's notion was to advise everyone to go jump in the lake when they are tainted with an unproven allegation. \n\n I reckon the secular cultural practice of absolution through ablution inspired the Early Morning Baptisers of Qumran to co-opt Hammurabi's Remedy into the Mikvah Ritual Bath. Baptismal sin cleansing survives to this day in most Christian denominations. \n\n Of course there was that interlude in the desert where there were no bodies of holy water, so Aaron devised an alternate ritual involving a delightful goat named Caprice. I am rather fond of Caprice, since her story inspired portions of the Passion of Christ. \n\n I find it ironic that a site that purports to offer the sum of all human knowledge is still struggling to learn the oldest lessons in the annals of human history. \n\n So I suggest people wash their hands of Jimbo's anachronistic cult of pre-Hammurabic tribalism, cleanse themselves of the grit by jumping in the lake, and evolving to a more modern and enlightened governance model along the lines suggested by such innovative pioneers as Moses, Socrates, Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tsu, Maimonides, Thomas Becket, Stephen Langton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, ML King, Thich Nhat Hanh, John Rawls, Father John Dear, Barak Obama, Kermit the Frog, and Barsoom Tork Associates. \n\n Barsoom Tork    \n \"","951":"\"::I'm confused that you think \"\"slur of homosexuals\"\" is \"\"more correct\"\" than anything.

I am sure that this is all still under discussion, but speaking as someone who has put quite a few hours into the IEP cleanup already, and who expects to have to do many more, I would be very disappointed if the program continues in anything like its current form.  I understand the post mortem is continuing, and I hope that the revised IEP plan for next semester will be on a scale that won't cause anything like the current impact, but because of the scale of the additional work caused I think a great many people will be very upset if there is not a very clear dialogue with the community about your plans before you commit to the IEP's next incarnation.  I've argued that the community should be more involved with the discussions about the future of the USEP, as you know; but as I've said in those discussions I think the USEP is in pretty good shape and if you decide to go in a different direction to the one I've suggested I think it will be OK.  For the IEP the stakes are much higher and I would really like to see these discussions take place on-wiki, at least simultaneously with the mailing list discussions.
