## Dataset Files

To avoid bloating Git with dataset files, we just have this folder as a placeholder where we can store our data.

The datasets which we use may be found at:
* [train.csv.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/c/8076/download/train.csv.zip)
* [test.csv.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/c/8076/download/test.csv.zip)
* [sample_submission.csv.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/c/8076/download/sample_submission.csv.zip)

**NOTE: you need a verified Kaggle account and must have accepted the rules of the competition to download these files!**
