This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  \n\n  \n i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very \"\"mean\"\" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows\u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by   \u2022    \n\n ==etymology== \n The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning \"\"female of the dog\"\" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that \"\"the converse is equally possible.\"\" \n The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  \n The verb meaning to complain in 1930. \n Slang Bitchen \"\"good\"\" is attested to the 1950's \n\n == reclaiming the word bitch == \n The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is \"\"pig\"\", \"\"dog\"\", \"\"cow\"\" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to \"\"reclaim\"\" as bitch simply means a female canine. \n\n It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. \n\n    \n It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women \"\"reclaiming\"\" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word \"\"bitch\"\" any more than it reclaims the word \"\"sinner.\"\" \n\n Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? \n\n \n\n :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, \"\"She's a Bitch\"\".   \n\n ::References are fine  just the name \"\"Missy Elliot\"\" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned \"\"reclaiming\"\" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women\/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   \n\n :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting \"\"querolous\"\", \"\"spiteful\"\", and \"\"malicious\"\" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   \n\n ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   \n\n :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like \"\"bitch\"\" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of \"\"bitch\"\" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it. \n\n :::::However, I still don't see the point of reclamati","39":"\" \n\n *@EdJohnston.

Third, assisting a suicide remains illegal in all three states - and also Montana and New Mexico. No state attorney general or county district attorney has charged any physician or pharmacist who acted within the aid in dying laws of the three states.

It's not at all controversial that EFT show more of an effect than some treatments in some conditions.  The problem is that EFT doesn't show more of an effect than talking and tapping your arm or talking and tapping a doll.   \n\n :::Second, I think you're not being quite forthright when you describe the accupressure citations as \"\"controvert[ing] this conclusion\"\".  In fact, you removed the last two and silently changed the other two.  If you want to change text that someone has already responded to, please use  and <\\s>, like this, so it doesn't look like you're being sneaky.  This also looks like you're throwing in every citation you can find without reading or understanding them, hoping something will stick.  If you recall, I asked for one pdf and we're now at numbers 16 and 17 and you're just now learning what the issues are.  And, after taking a look, neither one of your new studies has anything to do with establishing the existence of \"\"energy systems in the body\"\". \n\n :::I'm not sure what to say at this point.  The most charitable interpretation I can come up with is that you're not reading what you're citing:  you're either cutting and pasting from google or some other source.  Alternatively you're reading all of these papers but have no understanding as to what they contain.  Either way, you might want to consider editing articles that better play to your strengths. \n\n :::As to Feinstein's rejoinder:  it's available here.  This is an excellent lesson in tapdancing: \n\n ::::[The studies he found] lend[] support for the efficacy  of tapping while mentally attuning to an emotional difficulty. Despite the design flaws found in some of the  studies, the preponderance of evidence shows energy psychology interventions to be efficacious. \n\n :::The first sentence is true, but he neglects to explain why arm-tapping and doll-tapping have equal efficacy.  The second sentence equates talking and tapping with \"\"energy psychology\"\" which has the additional baggage of energy fields that can evidently migrate to arms and dolls.   \n\n :::So after 18 citations what we have is the suggestion that a particular kind of talking associated with some sort of physical ritual can be more helpful than other treatments in some situations.  I would be comfortable including the two Feinstein reviews if the shortcomings pointed out in Pignotti are highlighted, and I think Waite (2003) deserves a paragraph.  I don't see an argument for including any of these other citations.  If you want to make such an argument, please be sure to read the citation first and be able to summarize how the citation supports the point you want to make.    \n\n \"","87":"\" \n\n You wrote: \n\n You will need to cite reliable sources for the assertions \"\"far too large to be chemical\"\" and \"\"no endothermic storage events\"\". I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point . . . \n\n It is very easy to establish both points, and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them. \n\n 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. \n\n 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after. \n\n - Jed Rothwell \n\n  \n HERE IS more useful information that someone keeps erasing: \n\n Please note that Cal Tech (Lewis et al.) is a false negative, as pointed out by Noninski, Miles and Fleischmann.
